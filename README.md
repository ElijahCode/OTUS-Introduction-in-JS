# This is a repository containing homework solutions for the course Introduction in JavaScript

## Repository structure

In the root folder of the directory there are folders named like "HomeWorkâ„–..." with a homework solution. Folder numbering corresponds to the numbering of homework in the course.

There are 3 files in the folder: index.html, script.js and script.test.js. The functions of these files are shown below:

- The file index.html describes the markup of the page that shows the solution to the task. For most tasks, the display is implemented through the console.

- The file script.js contains functions that solve the tasks set in the homework. The implementation of a separate task (exercise) begins with the comment "exercise # ...".

- The file script.js contains tests that check the functionality of the functions located in the file script.test.js
